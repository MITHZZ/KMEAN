# KMEAN
Implementing a k-means clustering algorithm for given sets of points
Example format of text file will be (for 3 dimension) - points.txt
0.1 0.4 0.2
0.6 0.1 0.5
0.4 1.6 0.9
1.2 3.4 6.5
9.2 9.6 8.6

The algorithm should be a simple kmeans implementation without going into fancy kdtree speedup or nearest neighbor approximations.
